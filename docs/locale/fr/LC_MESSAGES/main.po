"If you want to publish your project to PyPi, you first have to make a "

"process."

msgid "`Setup.py`"
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:14
msgid ""
"As you can see in the `python setup`_ file included in this repository, "
"the syntax is quite basic."

#: ../main.rst:28
msgid "🎉 You simplify define that you want to use PBR_ and that's it! 🎉"
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:31
msgid "`Setup.cfg`"

#: ../main.rst:33
msgid ""
"As you can see in the `config setup`_ file included in this repository, "

"Two ways of enabling Travis are presented here. One using `Travis CLI`_ "

msgid "`Using travis CLI`"
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:100
msgid "Run :code:`travis login` and login to travis."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:102
msgid "Now you can run :code:`travis init`."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:104
msgid ""
"If you are in a git repository, Travis will detect it and ask if this is "
"correct."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:106
msgid "Otherwise, it will tell you it can detect the repo."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:108
msgid ""
"Once you hit :code:`Enter`, Travis asks the main language. In this case, "
"type :code:`Python`."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:110
msgid ""
"Now a new file called :code:`.travis.yml` has been created and is "
"available in your repo. Moreover, Travis is now enabled for this repo."

#: ../main.rst:112
msgid "We will go through this file later."

msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:128
msgid ""
"As the doc is really well made, I suggest you go check it first as I "
"won't explain everything. You can find it here https://docs.travis-"
"ci.com/user/getting-started/."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:130
msgid "However, I will explain the settings I usually use."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:181
msgid "`Password`"
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:183
msgid ""
"If you don't have `Travis CLI`_ installed, use the second option I "

msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:185
msgid ""
"In your profile page, find your project and click on the little gear ⚙️. "
"This will bring you to the settings."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:186
msgid "Go to the :code:`Environment Variables` section and add a new variable."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:187
msgid ""
"If you take my example, its name will be PYPI_PASSWORD and the value your"
" password."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:193
msgid "If you have `Travis CLI`_, this one is for you."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:195
msgid "Leave blank the password section, like the following."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:203
msgid ""
"Now let's encrypt it! Simply run :code:`travis encrypt --add "
"deploy.password` and Travis will ask for your password, encrypt it and "
"paste it to the file."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:205
msgid "🎉 Now your are ready to go! 🎉"
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:208
msgid "`✔️So what now?!`"
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:210
msgid ""
"Well, let's try to push everyhing to the repository to check if "
"everything is alright and if the tests pass!"
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:212
msgid "Go to `Travis home page`_ and check if everything went well!"
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:214
msgid ""
"As you remember, we haven't set up any tag in github so this commit "
"shouldn't get deployed."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:216
msgid "Travis will also tell it:"

#: ../main.rst:218
msgid ""
":code:`Skipping a deployment with the pypi provider because this is not a"
" tagged commit`"
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:221
msgid "`✔️Let's tag it!`"
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:223
msgid ""
"Now, create a tag. This is easy with git. Git tag doc can be found `here "
"<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:225
msgid ""
"Note that with :code:`git tag` the option :code:`-a` allows you to "
"specify the version and :code:`-m` the message."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:227
msgid "So your command will be the following:"
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:229
msgid ":code:`git tag -a 0.0.1 -m \"First pypi deployment\"`"
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:231
msgid ""
"Now you can check if it was created by running :code:`git tag`. The "
"result should look like the following."
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:239
msgid ""
"And now push and check again Travis and pypi and your package should be "
"deployed!"
msgstr ""

#: ../main.rst:241
msgid ""
"PSA: Don't forget to add :code:`--tags` to your push command otherwise "
"they will stay in your local repo."
